# About this repository
This repository contains my personal configuration for ubuntu, though it should work on other sitros (and on macOS, though I haven't tested that).
Included are my configs for oh-my-zsh and my aliases as well as my personal scripts.
When the install script is run, zsh as well as oh-my-zsh should be installed.

The following is installed:
- git
- google chrome
- zsh
- oh-my-zsh
- docker
- vscode
- vim
